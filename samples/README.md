# Samples
This directory contains sample cartridges for the Sharpie to serve as learning material and to assemble and play around with. Below is a comprehensive list of all sample cartridges contained here.

- **sound_check.asm**: Exactly what it says on the tin. Press the arrow keys (except the right one, since I couldn't bother adding a fourth sound) to hear the Sharpie sing.

- **bluescreen.asm**: Tests the segfault functions of the sharpie BIOS. Each arrow key triggers a different segfault. 

- **save_test.asm**: Saves the numbers 0-9 on disk.

- **mario_sprite.asm**: Simple palette swap demo. Press A to swap to Luigi and B to swap to fire flower form.
