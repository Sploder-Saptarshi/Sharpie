# Sharpie Assembly Editor Support
Tired of writing code in plain white text like a barbarian? Well, toil no more.
This folder contains editor formatting support for NeoVim and VS Code.

## Neovim
1. Symlink (or copy, but prefer symlink) both folders in `nvim/` to the root of your NeoVim config.
2. Restart nvim.
3. Marvel at the fact someone actually wrote something in VimScript in 2026.

## VS Code
1. Symlink (again, you can copy but prefer symlinking so updates are automatic) the `vscode/` folder to your VS Code extensions folder.
2. Restart VS Code.
