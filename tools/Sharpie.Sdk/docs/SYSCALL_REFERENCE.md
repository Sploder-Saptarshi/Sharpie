# Sharpie BIOS calls

At startup, the Sharpie BIOS loads a few pre-defined subroutines into the reserved ROM space. These aim
to help you with more menial tasks so you can focus on actual game logic.

## SYS_MEM_IDX_READ(start, index, stride)
**Address: $FA2A** 

Loads a value from an index within a lookup table (LUT) and
saves it to memory. Also useful for structs, but you must manage the layout and padding carefully.

### Parameters:
- $E800 - Start: The memory address of the first element of the LUT. 2 bytes.
- $E802 - Index: The zero-based index of the element we want to retrieve. 2 bytes.
- $E804 - Stride: The size of each element in the LUT in bytes. 1 byte.

### Function:
The CPU calculates (stride × index), adds it to the starting address,
and reads (stride) consecutive bytes starting from the resulting address.
Then, the results are saved to work RAM starting at $E805 and ending at $E805 + (stride - 1).

### Notes:
If stride is 1, an 8-bit write is performed, so only $E805 is overwritten.
If stride ≥ 2, (stride) consecutive bytes are written starting at $E805,
using 16-bit reads and writes.

This subroutine overwrites these registers:
- R0
- R1
- R2
- R3
All other registers are preserved.
